       </div> <hr>
        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>Nothing special. Just a regular accounting major that learns to code, makes ads and writes about psychology and many other subjects. But I'm a paradox, my day job is that of a commerce student but nothing in my life has anything to do with it. It's better to expect my scattered minded, unpredictable behaviour so not to disappoint yourself :)</p>
        <h2>Why this blog?</h2>
        <p>I don't neccesarily want to be a writer but I have indeed tried a few times to write and earn some bucks with it. No luck so far. I used to write on substack, blogger and medium, all of which are either very tough to monetize or pay very less.</p>
        <p>So i thought, if i have to write for free, why not write on my own website? My reason for making this website is to use it as a personal diary. It's less of a blog and more of documentation of the things I do and learn.</p>
        <h2>What do I write about?</h2>
        <p>Whatever piques my interest at that moment. I have tried committing to a single niche many times but it just feels miserable. I intend to write about anything and everything that i want to write about.</p>
