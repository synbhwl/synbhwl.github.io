        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>Just a regular accounting major that learns to code, makes ads and writes about various subjects. It's better to expect my scattered minded, unpredictable and blunt behaviour so not to disappoint yourself.</p>
        <h2>Why this blog?</h2>
        <p>I have tried writing on various wesbites. I couldn't monetize any. So i thought, if i have to write for free, why not write on my own website? But it's supposed to be less of a blog and more of a documentation of the things I do and learn.</p>
        <h2>What do I write about?</h2>
        <p>Whatever piques my interest at that moment. I have tried committing to a single niche many times but it just feels miserable. I intend to write about anything and everything that i want to write about.</p>
